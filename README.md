- To run all the tests in headed mode (opening the web browser), so that run one after the other, with no pause, run
   - `npm test`
> Note: After finishing running the test in the web browser, also it's necessary to wait for completion in the terminal console, until the HTML report opens automatically with the test results.

- To run the test by opening the Cypress UI and handle the test run at will, run
   - `npm run cy:open`

- To run the test in headless mode (without opening the web browser), run
   - `npm run cy:headless`

> Note (After running the tests):
- The last 2 options only generate report in terminal console (No HTML report).
